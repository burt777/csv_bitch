=== Overview ===

This script is intended for use in Adobe Illustrator CC 2015 (but might work in other versions). 

It opens a dialog that allows you to select an input file, a CSV file and an output directory. The first line in the CSV file (line 0), should contain texts that are also in the input file (in text frames, any text object in the image). For every next line, a new file is created where the texts from line 0 are replaced by the texts in this line. 

If the checkbox for Case Sensitivity is checked, the matching between input file and line 0 is done case Sensitively. This might result in values not being found if the case differs between input file and the first line in the CSV.

If the checkbox for line 0 is checked, a file is generated for line 0 as well. This is identical to the input file (except for letter casing if case sensitivity is NOT on). 

There's nothing fancy about the way CSV (comma seperated values) are read. There's no escape character (just use a different delimiter if you want to use the ; in a field). There's no support for quoted text, etcetera. If a line contains more values than line 0, the surplus values are simply ignored without warning. If a line contains less values, a warning is added to the file name. 

=== CSV === 

NOTE!! The CSV should be in plain text, utf-8, no quotes around strings. The default delimiter is the semi-colon ;, but if you want to use another delimiter (e.g. because the ; is in use in some of the text), that's fine. If some matches can not be made, a warning will be displayed. If the texts in the warning look "strange" (like bla%A0%28blub%29 containing %-signs), it's a sign the CSV file is not saved in the proper encoding. Choose Utf-8, or otherwise make sure the encoding of the CSV matches the encoding of the input file.

=== Installation ===

Easy:
Download the file csv_bitch.csv to /Applications/Adobe Illustrator CC 2015/Presets.localized/en_US/Scripts/

From the command line:
$ cd "/Applications/Adobe Illustrator CC 2015/Presets.localized/en_US/Scripts" 
(or whatever your Illustrator version is)
$ curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burt777/csv_bitch/master/csv_bitch.jsx" -o csv_bitch.jsx


=== (Bonus) Merging PDFs ===

If you want to merge all PDFs into one big document (one page per PDF), you can easily use the command line in OSX: go to /Applications/Utilities, double click on "Terminal". Type (or paste):

"/System/Library/Automator/Combine PDF Pages.action/Contents/Resources/join.py" -o ~/Desktop/Output.pdf ~/*.pdf

Where "~/Desktop/Output.pdf" is the output file you're creating
And "~/*.pdf" are the input files; meaning all (*) .pdf files in home directory ~. Change the home directory in whatever you used as output directory.
